# Classic Outlining Icons for VS2022

This is a proof of concept on how to change the disaster chevrons that Microsoft chose to force upon us in VS2022.

You can change the Plus/Minus colors by navigating to Tools -> Options -> Classic Outlining

Please note that for the colors to change, you need to close and reopen the files.

Feel free to use this as a base for a Visual Studio Marketplace extension, or just use it as is.
